# HR_Absenteeism_Anaysis
A Power BI dashboard project for analyzing employee absenteeism and workload trends to improve organizational performance

## Problem Statement
You are a manager or analyst at a medium-sized company. You have noticed a drop in performance from the team. You investigate the causes and find that absenteeism is quite a problem. You need to determine how to help those who are missing work.

You are provided with a Human Resources Absenteeism dataset. You are required to use this dataset and build a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will then be used to gather insights and answer questions regarding employee absenteeism.

## Key Responsibilities and Outcomes
- I conducted data cleaning, transformation, and analysis on the Human Resources Absenteeism dataset using Power Query and DAX.
- I developed a comprehensive 2 page Power BI dashboard that effectively visualizes and communicates absenteeism trends and insights to stakeholders.
_ I identified patterns in absenteeism and the relationship between workload and absentee days.
