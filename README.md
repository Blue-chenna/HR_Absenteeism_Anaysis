# HR_Absenteeism_Anaysis
A Power BI dashboard project for analyzing employee absenteeism and workload trends to improve organizational performance

## Problem Statement
You are a manager or analyst at a medium-sized company. You have noticed a drop in performance from the team. You investigate the causes and find that absenteeism is quite a problem. You need to determine how to help those who are missing work.

You are provided with a Human Resources Absenteeism dataset. You are required to use this dataset and build a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will then be used to gather insights and answer questions regarding employee absenteeism.

## Key Responsibilities and Outcomes
- I conducted data cleaning, transformation, and analysis on the Human Resources Absenteeism dataset using Power Query and DAX.
- I developed a comprehensive 2 page Power BI dashboard that effectively visualizes and communicates absenteeism trends and insights to stakeholders.
- I identified patterns in absenteeism and the relationship between workload and absentee days.

## Key Insights
- The analysis revealed that employees with higher workloads tended to have more absent days compared to those with lower workloads.
- Analyzed and highlighted key reasons for employee absence to identify trends and potential areas for intervention.
- Presented data on disciplinary status through visual representations like donut charts.

## Dashboard Features
Some of the features of my dashboard includes:
- **Employee Profile Overview**: Includes ID, total absent days, workload average per employee, distance from home, number of children and pets, BMI/health status, and educational background, etc.
- **Disciplinary Status**: A donut chart showing the percentage of employees who adhered to disciplinary standards.
- **Performance Metrics**: A multi-row card displaying key data such as total absent days, average absent hours, average hit targets, total workload averages, and average service time.
- **Absenteeism and Workload Relationship**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between total absent days per employee and their average workload per day, illustrating trends that indicate employees with higher workloads may have higher absenteeism.
- **Absence Reasons Analysis**: Visualized the most common reasons for absenteeism and their frequency.
